# 7Days7Designs-Challenge1 (Whoops, Typo in the Repo name)

Challenge 1: Design a signup form. 
I wanted to try finish this before the end of day 1 but I only had an hour or so.
I didn't have time to add a success design or add any real javascript here but I'd love to come back and finish it.
I tried to have 2 layouts. For small screen devices, a vertical/column design. for larger devices a row based design.
