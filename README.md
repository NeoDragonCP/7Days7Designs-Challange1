# 7Days7Designs-Challenge

Challenge by DesignCourse: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVyRiMvfUNMA1UPlDPzG5Ow

(Whoops, Typo in the Repo name)
(This repo started as just Day 1 but all challenges I try will be added here)

I love creating designs, following design rules, and implementing them in HTML/CSS.
I decided to try and tackle DesignCourses 7days7Designs challenge while stuck indoors during this period.
In his videos he talks about the rules you must follow, usually a required basic layout.
My goal is to try and "keep up" with the challenges each day, finish my work on the day or take just 1 day if I'm behind and do what I can.
I'd also like to design for BOTH mobile and desktop (something that isn't asked).

I plan on using just vanilla HTML/CSS but I may add in some Javascript, React, or SCSS.

All my designs will be created in Figma first. You'll have to trust me that I matched/closely matched those designs! :D

I wanted to try finish this before the end of day 1 but I only had an hour or so.
I didn't have time to add a success design or add any real javascript here but I'd love to come back and finish it.
I tried to have 2 layouts. For small screen devices, a vertical/column design. for larger devices a row based design.
